This is not a subpackage!

PYTHONPATH has an entry for this directory automatically appended for all Python code
that is executed via tests.debug.Session.

Thus, it should be used for modules that are meant to be importable by such debugged
code, and that are not test-specific - for example, backchannel.

Because this code runs in the debuggee process, it cannot import anything from the
top-level tests package. It can, however, import ptvsd and pydevd.
