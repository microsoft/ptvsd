Pass --ptvsd-logs and/or --pydevd-logs to pytest to create log files here for a run.
For example:

    tox -e py37 -- --ptvsd-logs "tests/ptvsd/server/test_run.py::test_run[launch-file]"

A separate ptvsd-{pid}.log file will be created for every ptvsd process spawned by
the tests. However, because process IDs are reused by OS, logs may end up overwriting
earlier logs.

All pydevd logs go into the same file named pydevd.log - and subsequent tests will
overwrite earlier logs.

Thus, it is best to use this when running a single test, or a small number of tests.
