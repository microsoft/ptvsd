Pass --ptvsd-logs and/or --pydevd-logs to pytest to create log files here for a run.
For example:

    tox -e py37 -- --ptvsd-logs "tests/ptvsd/server/test_run.py::test_run[launch-file]"

A separate directory will be created for every test. In that directory, a separate
subdirectory will be created for every debug.Session instance, containing ptvsd logs
for the processes that it spawns, and pydevd log.

If the test has failed, an empty file called FAILED.log is additionally created in
the test log directory, to easily find all failed tests after a large run.
