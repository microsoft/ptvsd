    Parameters
    ----------
    address : (str, int), optional
        Specifies the interface and port on which the debugging server should
        listen for TCP connections. It is in the same format as used for
        regular sockets of the `socket.AF_INET` family, i.e. a tuple of
        ``(hostname, port)``. On client side, the server is identified by the
        Qualifier string in the usual ``'hostname:port'`` format, e.g.:
        ``'myhost.cloudapp.net:5678'``. Default is ``('0.0.0.0', 5678)``.

        by this program should be sent to the debugger. Default is ``True``.

    Notes
    -----
    This function returns immediately after setting up the debugging server,
    and does not block program execution. If you need to block until debugger
    is attached, call `ptvsd.wait_for_attach`. The debugger can be detached
    and re-attached multiple times after `enable_attach` is called.

    Only the thread on which this function is called, and any threads that are
    created after it returns, will be visible in the debugger once it is
    attached. Any threads that are already running before this function is
    called will not be visible.
