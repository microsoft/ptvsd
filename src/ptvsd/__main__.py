    # ptvsd can also be invoked directly rather than via -m. In this case, the first
    # entry on sys.path is the one added automatically by Python for the directory
    # containing this file. This means that import ptvsd will not work, since we need
    # the parent directory of ptvsd/ to be in sys.path, rather than ptvsd/ itself.
    #
    # The other issue is that many other absolute imports will break, because they
    # will be resolved relative to ptvsd/ - e.g. `import debugger` will then try
    # to import ptvsd/debugger.py.
    #
    # To fix both, we need to replace the automatically added entry such that it points
    # at parent directory of ptvsd/ instead of ptvsd/ itself, import ptvsd with that
    # in sys.path, and then remove the first entry entry altogether, so that it doesn't
    # affect any further imports we might do. For example, suppose the user did:
    #
    #   python /foo/bar/ptvsd ...
    #
    # At the beginning of this script, sys.path will contain "/foo/bar/ptvsd" as the
    # first entry. What we want is to replace it with "/foo/bar', then import ptvsd
    # with that in effect, and then remove the replaced entry before any more
    # code runs. The imported ptvsd module will remain in sys.modules, and thus all
    # future imports of it or its submodules will resolve accordingly.
